# Requirements Document

## Introduction

EchoMe X is an AI Twin platform MVP that allows users to create digital personas that speak and interact like them. The MVP will be a lightweight, deployable web application built with Express + MongoDB backend and HTML/CSS/JS frontend, deployed on Render/Railway (backend) and Vercel/Netlify (frontend). The system integrates with Groq/OpenAI for AI responses and uses real user data.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create my AI Twin by entering basic persona details, so that I can quickly generate a digital version of myself.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the landing page THEN the system SHALL display a "Generate Twin" interface
2. WHEN a user enters their name and persona details THEN the system SHALL accept the input through a simple form
3. WHEN a user submits the form THEN the system SHALL create a twin profile based on the entered persona details
4. WHEN the twin is created THEN the system SHALL store the user data in MongoDB and redirect to the chat interface

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to chat with my AI Twin through a simple interface, so that I can interact with my digital persona.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the chat page THEN the system SHALL display a chat interface for their AI twin
2. WHEN a user sends a message THEN the system SHALL accept the input and display it in the chat
3. WHEN a message is sent THEN the system SHALL generate a response using Groq or OpenAI based on the user's persona
4. WHEN a response is generated THEN the system SHALL display the AI twin's reply in the chat interface

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view analytics about my AI Twin's engagement, so that I can see the future vision of AI-assisted social influence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the analytics page THEN the system SHALL display a dashboard with engagement metrics
2. WHEN analytics are requested THEN the system SHALL show follower count and engagement percentages for demonstration
3. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL present analytics data that demonstrates future social influence capabilities
4. WHEN analytics are displayed THEN the system SHALL format the data in an appealing visual layout

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the backend API to handle twin creation and chat functionality, so that the frontend can interact with the AI twin system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the /api/train endpoint receives a request THEN the system SHALL accept user name and persona data and save it to MongoDB
2. WHEN the /api/chat endpoint receives a message THEN the system SHALL return a twin response using Groq or OpenAI
3. WHEN the /api/analytics/:userId endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL return engagement numbers for the dashboard
4. WHEN any API endpoint fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error responses with status codes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to be accessible and deployable, so that I can use it from anywhere and others can access it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is deployed THEN the backend SHALL be accessible on Render or Railway
2. WHEN the frontend is deployed THEN it SHALL be accessible on Vercel or Netlify
3. WHEN a user accesses the application THEN all three pages (landing, chat, analytics) SHALL load correctly
4. WHEN the system is running THEN it SHALL not require Docker for deployment and operation
